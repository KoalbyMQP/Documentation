        This project will center around the development of two toddler-sized 3D-printed humanoid robots designed for versatile human interaction and lab support. These humanoid robots will be equipped with a range of capabilities, including achieving primitive movements, standing without external support, and walking unassisted. The initiative will cover various key areas of focus to enhance the functionality of these robots. <br><br>

        Initially, the project will address the optimization of wiring, motors, and electronics to ensure robust performance. This will include the integration of kinematic and trajectory planning to mimic human movements and simplify motion control. To accommodate the new motors and sensors, additional batteries and power circuits will be integrated into the robots' design. <br><br>
        
        To facilitate evaluation and testing, a comprehensive simulation model is being developed using CoppeliaSim. This will enable realistic simulations and troubleshooting. Additionally, the team will design a user-friendly interface for monitoring the humanoid robots, offering access to sensor data and various control functionalities. <br><br>

        Sensors will be integrated to aid in navigating their surroundings and maintaining stability during primitive movements and walking. <br><br>
    
        To streamline the robots' design and make them more cost-effective, all Dynamixel motors will be replaced with HerkuleX DRS motors. This change will not only ensure uniformity in design and programming but also help reduce costs, making the project more budget-friendly. <br><br>
        
        In summary, this project aims to elevate the capabilities of our previously designed 3D-printed humanoid robots, enabling them to achieve primitive movements, stand without external support, and walk unassisted with precision and stability. Enhancements will primarily focus on sensor integration, transforming these robots into versatile and cost-effective lab assistants for various tasks in the laboratory.
