# Getting Started with Documentation

Welcome to the documentation tutorial! This guide will help you learn how to create and manage documentation using Docusaurus. We'll cover three main approaches:

## Available Guides

### [Writing with Markdown](./markdown/index.md)
Learn how to write documentation using Markdown syntax and manage your content with Git and GitHub Desktop. This is the recommended approach for developers and technical writers who want full control over their content.

### [Content Management System (CMS)](./cms/index.md)
Discover how to use Decap CMS to manage your documentation through a user-friendly web interface. This approach is ideal for non-technical users who prefer a visual editor.

### [Local Development](./local-testing/index.md)
Learn how to set up and run the documentation site locally to preview your changes before publishing. This guide covers installation, configuration, and testing procedures.

## Choosing Your Approach

   - Full control over content
   - Version control with Git

2. **CMS** (Recommended for non-technical users)

Choose the guide that best fits your role and technical comfort level. We recommend starting with the Markdown guide if you're new to documentation.
