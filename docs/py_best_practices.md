This document outlines best practices for managing Python repositories efficiently.

**Overview:**
- **Source File Tracking:** Only include source files necessary to generate or run the code.
- **Ignoring Generated Files:** Prevent noise in commits by ignoring compiled files (e.g., *.pyc, __pycache__/).
- **Virtual Environments:** Keep your dependencies isolated.
- **Coding Style & Quality:** Enforce PEP8 guidelines and code formatting.
- **Testing & CI:** Integrate tests and continuous integration to maintain code quality.

For a comprehensive guide on Python development practices (with OS-specific instructions, cleanup commands, and more), see our [Python Development Guide](./python-dev-guide/index.md).
